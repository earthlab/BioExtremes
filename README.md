# BioExtremes
Project funded by CIRES IRP 2023

The main objective of this project is to develop an open-source tool that facilitates the use and integration of the new generation of space-borne laser scanners and imaging spectrometers for studies on biodiversity and extreme events. The specific objectives are: 1. Understand the effects of anomalous rainfall and wind gusts on mangrove ecosystem homogenization worldwide, and 2. Assess the role of species diversity in ecosystem response to extreme events.

The Bioextreme open-source tool has the following features:

## 1. Subsetting and Downloading GEDI Data

- Granule-level filter tool: can be used to determine the URLs of granules intersecting a polygon, bounding box, or a union or intersection of such shapes - mangrovegranules.py  
- Shot-level filter tool: can be used to discard irrelevant or low-quality data according to the userâ€™s specifications from within a granule after it is downloaded - mangroveshots.py 

## 2. Downloading ERA-5 data and comparison with International Best Track Archive (IBTrACS) wind speeds

- Download ERA-5 instantaneous 10m wind speed: can be used to download 
- IBTrACS and ERA5 maximum wind speeds comparison: can be used to calculate cyclone-force winds from the ERA5 instantaneous 10m wind speed - windspeedcomparison.py
