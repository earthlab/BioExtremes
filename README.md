# BioExtremes
Project funded by CIRES IRP 2023

The main objective of this project is to develop an open-source tool that facilitates the use and integration of the new generation of space-borne laser scanners and imaging spectrometers for studies on biodiversity and extreme events. The specific objectives are: 1. Understand the effects of anomalous rainfall and wind gusts on mangrove ecosystem homogenization worldwide, and 2. Assess the role of species diversity in ecosystem response to extreme events.
